# Swap ChatMessage's generic FK (→ Lead) for a direct FK (→ Deal).
#
# A LinkedIn DM thread is one shared conversation per person, but outreach is
# per-(lead, campaign) = per Deal. Moving the message onto the Deal makes each
# campaign's conversation self-contained and drops the generic-FK machinery.
#
# Two data steps:
#   (a) Delete legacy NULL-urn rows. These came from a retired send path that
#       recorded the outgoing message at send time (before LinkedIn assigned a
#       urn); sync later re-fetched the same messages *with* urns, leaving stale
#       duplicates. Today's sync never writes a NULL urn, so this is one-time cruft.
#   (b) Backfill the deal. A message's lead may have several deals:
#         1 deal              → assign to it
#         ≥2 deals, ≥1 "live" → assign to each live deal (the only case we clone)
#         ≥2 deals, 0 live    → assign to one archival home (most-recently-updated
#                               messageable deal, else most-recently-updated deal)
#       "live" = CONNECTED with no outcome — the exact follow-up eligibility, i.e.
#       the only deals that will read the history again. Terminal deals get no copy.
