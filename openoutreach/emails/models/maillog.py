# openoutreach/emails/models/maillog.py
"""The mail log — what happened, kept apart from what it meant.

Every message our mailboxes emit or receive gets a row **before** anything
decides what it is, and every answer a receiving server gives about a send gets
its own row. That separation is the whole point of this module:

> the record is complete, factual and append-only; the interpretation is derived,
> versioned and recomputable.

While reading *was* deciding, a message the reader had no rule for left no trace:
*unread* and *nothing to read* were the same state, so nine days of lost mail
looked exactly like nine quiet days, and the only human reply an install ever
received is not in its CRM. Here the bytes land first, ``kind`` is written by a
pure pass over them (``emails/classify.py``), and improving the rules means
bumping ``classifier_version`` and re-running over every message ever received —
history is repaired, not just future mail.

Nothing here knows about deals, campaigns or leads. A stranger cold-mailing the
box is a ``Thread`` with no deal: recorded, classified ``unrelated``, and not a
special case.
