"""The email schema, in two layers.

``mailbox.py`` is the sending identity. ``maillog.py`` is the **mail log**: one
row per message this install emitted or received, and one row per thing a
receiving server said about a send. The log is the record; ``kind`` and the
conversation projected from it are the interpretation, and they are derived from
rows that never move.
