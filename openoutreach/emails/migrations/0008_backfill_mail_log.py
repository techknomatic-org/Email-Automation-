# openoutreach/emails/migrations/0008_backfill_mail_log.py
"""Rebuild the mail log from the conversation it is replacing.

Every id needed is already stored — the opener's Message-ID on the deal and each
turn's on ``ChatMessage.external_id`` — so no history is lost in the move. What
cannot be recovered is raw bytes for mail received before the mirror existed;
those rows carry their text and nothing else, and the classifier is told never to
re-read a row it has no bytes for.

Forward-only. Reversing it would mean rebuilding a table this design deleted.
"""

# The classifier version these rows are stamped with. They were classified by the
# reader that wrote them — an outgoing row is a send, an incoming one is a reply
# somebody wrote — and with no bytes kept there is nothing for a later version to
# re-read, so stamping them current keeps a re-run from overwriting a true verdict
# with a guess.
