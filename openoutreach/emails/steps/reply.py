# openoutreach/emails/steps/reply.py
"""Answering someone who wrote back — the only outbound mail after the first email.

This step runs on a deal whose newest inbound message is newer than its newest
outgoing one, so there is always something to answer and the agent is never asked
to decide about silence. That is the whole follow-up policy: **a lead who does not
reply is never emailed again.**

What that deletes is worth naming, because it was the most intricate machinery in
the old scheduler. There was a per-deal countdown (``next_follow_up_at``) that the
agent itself re-armed in business hours; a claim priority putting follow-ups above
first emails; and — because that priority is not ownership — a floor
(``OPENER_FLOOR_FRACTION``) reserving a quarter of the mailbox for first contact,
capped in turn by the openers actually ready to send so nothing idled. All of it
existed because open threads accumulate faster than they close, so an unbounded
follow-up drain eventually owned every send in the box: measured on a live install,
102 follow-ups and 1 first email in a week. None of it is needed once a reply is
the trigger — replies are bounded by how many people write back, and they are not
cold volume, so they compete for nothing.

Sending here is therefore **exempt from the daily cap and from send spacing**.
Answering within minutes of being written to is more human, not less.
