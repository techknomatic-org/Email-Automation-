# openoutreach/emails/steps/send.py
"""The first email — the only cold message this person will ever get.

The outreach agent opens the conversation, SMTP sends it, and the send is recorded
on the Deal, which moves it to EMAILED. From there the deal is only ever touched
again if the recipient answers.

That is the whole reason this step is the one under a cap. A first email is *cold
volume*, which is what a receiver punishes; a reply inside a thread someone started
is not, and goes out with no cap and no spacing (``steps/reply.py``). So the two
guards — the box's measured daily ceiling and the ≥3-minute spacing — live here and
nowhere else.
