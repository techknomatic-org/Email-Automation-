# openoutreach/emails/sync.py
"""**sync** — mirror a mailbox's inbound mail into the log. Transport only.

The one job that touches the network, and the only one that does. It stores bytes
and says nothing about what they mean: a message it keeps lands as a row with no
``kind`` and no ``processed_at``, because the state that did not exist — *fetched,
not yet interpreted* — is what let nine days of lost mail read as nine quiet days.
Deciding what a message *is* happens later, over stored bytes, and can be redone.

Two rules carry the correctness here, and neither is the cursor:

- **Identity is the Message-ID**, never the UID. A re-walk stores nothing new, so
  ``FolderCoverage`` is a fetch optimisation in front of a unique key rather than
  the record of what was read. Reset it to zero and the box is simply re-read.
- **A message that cannot be fetched is not stepped over.** The walk stops in
  front of it and the next pass retries. The cursor advances to what was
  *stored*, one message at a time — never to ``UIDNEXT`` or to a ``max()`` over
  what was merely seen, which is the shape that lost UID 27 and 28 for good.

**Only our own conversation is stored.** A mailbox is a person's real mailbox, and
mirroring everything that lands in it would make a CRM out of their private mail —
and a large one, on a box with years of history. A message is recorded when — and
only when — one of four things is true:

- it names a Message-ID this box minted (``References``/``In-Reply-To``), which is
  the hidden id every send carries;
- it is addressed to the ``+unsub`` alias, which is how a client's unsubscribe
  button arrives and carries no threading headers at all;
- it comes from an address this box has written to;
- it is a non-delivery report. A bounce arrives from the receiver's own daemon,
  quotes our headers in a body part rather than in the envelope, and is the one
  piece of mail that is unambiguously about a send of ours even when nothing in
  its headers threads.

The rule about *addresses we have written to* is what keeps the repair property
that matters. A reply whose threading headers we mis-read is still stored — it
came from someone we mailed — so a corrected rule re-reads it and recovers the
conversation. What is skipped is mail from people this box has never written to,
which no threading fix could have turned into one of our replies.

Skipped messages are counted and logged, never silently passed: the walk says how
much of the box it declined to keep, so "we hold nothing about this" and "nothing
arrived" stay different statements.
