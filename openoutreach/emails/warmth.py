# openoutreach/emails/warmth.py
"""Measure a mailbox's warm capacity from its own send history.

The per-box daily ceiling is not declared, it is read off the box: IMAP the Sent
folder, bucket the messages by day, and let what the box has demonstrably
sustained decide what it may send today. This is the only warmth signal
available at cold-outreach volume — Google Postmaster Tools suppresses its
metrics below roughly 100 messages/day to Gmail, an order above where a safe
cold sender operates, and seed-list placement tests measure a panel rather than
the box.

Reading the Sent folder (rather than counting our own mail-log rows) is
deliberate: the receiver counts *every* message the box emits — a human's mail,
a provider's warmup traffic — and a ceiling derived from our own ledger alone
would be blind to all of it.

The measurement is a cache, never state: it is recomputed from the box each day
and can be discarded at any time without losing anything. Only the value is
stored (on ``Mailbox.daily_limit``, because reading it costs an IMAP round trip
and the send path consults it constantly); *when* the pool was last measured is a
single process-held date, so a restart just re-measures. An unreachable box keeps its last
measurement rather than falling to zero — a flaky network is not evidence about
reputation.
