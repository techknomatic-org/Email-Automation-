# openoutreach/emails/classify.py
"""**classify** — decide what a stored message is. Pure, versioned, no network.

Reads the bytes ``sync`` kept and our own tables, and writes ``kind``, the derived
``body_text`` and the thread. Nothing else. That is what makes it re-runnable:
improve a rule, bump ``CLASSIFIER_VERSION``, and every message ever received is
re-read — **history is repaired, not only future mail**.

While reading *was* deciding, a rule that declined to keep a message deleted it.
The rules below are therefore allowed to be wrong: everything ``sync`` kept is
stored whole, so a message this classifier calls ``unrelated`` today can be read
again tomorrow and recovered. Only the sync-level rule about *whose* mail we keep
is irreversible, which is why it is drawn around the conversation rather than
around anything the classifier believes.

Order matters. An NDR is auto-submitted and quotes our own headers, so it would
answer to three of these rules; it is asked about first, because an NDR that
reads as a reply is what put a live install in a two-turn apology loop with a
dead address.
