# openoutreach/emails/project.py
"""**project** — act on what a classified message means. No network, no bytes.

The third job, and the only one allowed to change anything outside the log: a
bounce becomes a ``DeliveryEvent`` against the send it killed, an opt-out
suppresses the person who asked. Everything it writes is derived from rows that
never move, so a corrected classification simply clears ``processed_at`` and the
projection is redone.

A ``human_reply`` is projected by doing **nothing**: it is already a turn in its
thread, and the cycle finds the deal by comparing the thread's newest inbound turn
with its newest outbound one. There is no second copy of the conversation to keep
in step — which is the dual-write this design deleted.

Nothing here decides what a bounce *means for a deal*. Whether a dead address
ends the pursuit or sends it back for re-enrichment is policy, and it is owned by
``p1-e2-email-bounce-detection-suppression``. This card only makes the bounce
visible — which is the part that was missing while capacity ramped ×1.5/day
against 590 sends and zero recorded verdicts.
