# openoutreach/emails/delivery_policy.py
"""Read the receiver's answer to a send, and decide what it means.

Every send ends in a verdict from the receiving server, and until now that
verdict was thrown away: ``sender.py`` let the exception propagate, the task was
marked FAILED, and the SMTP code — the only direct statement anyone makes about
this mailbox's standing — was lost in the traceback.

The distinction this module exists to draw is that **a failed send is not one
kind of event**. Three things arrive down the same exception channel and mean
completely different things:

- the receiver deferring us (4xx) — *slow down*, and it expects us to retry;
  routine, and a sporadic one costs nothing
- the receiver refusing us (5xx) — either we hit the real daily ceiling or the
  box has been actioned; the two need opposite responses
- nothing to do with the receiver at all — a dropped socket, a rejected
  password. These say nothing whatsoever about reputation, and treating them as
  if they did means a flaky network quietly throttles a healthy mailbox.

There is deliberately no retry ladder here and no rate threshold. A deferred
cold opener is not a message we have accepted responsibility for: the deal stays
READY_TO_EMAIL and ``reconcile`` re-mints it, already spaced by the send pacing.
And capacity does not need an explicit cut — a box that sends less leaves less
in its Sent folder, which ``warmth.py`` reads back the next day.
