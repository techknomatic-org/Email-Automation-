"""Threading — union-find over Message-IDs, which is how every mail client does it.

A conversation is a graph, not a root pointer. Each message names the ids it is
answering; a message inherits the thread of anything it names, and when it names
two threads at once — the halves of a chain that arrived out of order — those
threads are merged into one.

The rule this replaces matched the **root** only (``Deal.email_message_id``, the
opener's Message-ID). That works while the client on the other end sends
``References``, which carries the whole chain. A client that sends only
``In-Reply-To`` points at the *latest* message instead, matches nothing, and its
reply is dropped — every id needed to place it was already stored on the outgoing
rows and simply never queried.
