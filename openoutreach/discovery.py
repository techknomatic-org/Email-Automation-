# ``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``:
#
# - ``lead_industry`` — inert. ``zzqqxxnonsense`` returns the *identical* count to
#   no filter at all, so the field is silently dropped (§8).
# - ``lead_function`` — not a second field. It and ``lead_department`` are one
#   field reachable under two names, and their values are merged into a single
#   ORed include-list, so naming both *widens* the query (§2).
# - ``lead_department`` — real, but unreachable from a profile. Lead Finder emits
#   no department on a lead row, so no vocabulary can ever grow for it, and its
#   whole live vocabulary is four values nobody would guess (no Engineering, no
#   Finance — §3). An axis with no token source is dead weight.
#
# The field names are the contract; the tokens are search terms. An unknown *key*
# is dropped without a word and hands back the unfiltered page **with rows**, which
# reads as success — so keys are constrained here and in the pydantic schemas. An
# unknown *value* is benign: an empty page, one move spent.
