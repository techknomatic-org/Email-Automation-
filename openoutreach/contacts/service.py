# openoutreach/contacts/service.py
"""The central contacts store (the hub) — ask the hub before paying BetterContact,
give back what we find.

Two best-effort calls; a missing token or an outage degrades to a no-op and never
breaks outreach. The store caches ``public_identifier -> email`` so the network's
paid + harvested resolutions lower everyone's BetterContact spend as coverage grows.

The geo-gate that keeps EEA/UK/CH out of the store is enforced **server-side** (the
only trusted boundary). The cheap ``is_eea_located`` check here just avoids a
pointless round-trip for a lead we already know is out of scope — it reads the
lead's own ``country_code`` (persisted at discovery), so there is no extra scrape.
