        displaces an invented one and the last of them ends the phase, turning every
        downstream ranking into one backed by ground truth. Exploit serves it directly —
        the highest-P lead is the one most like the ideal profile, so it is the likeliest
        genuine fit.

        The class balance cannot decide the axis during that phase, and it is not merely
        that it would decide wrong: the anchors are *held at* the shortfall, so
        ``n_neg > n_pos`` is false by construction and the balance has no information in
        it at all.

        BALD serves the opposite. Information gain is the right objective when both
        classes are real and the question is where the boundary sits; with invented
        positives it spends every LLM call on the lead the model is *most confused*
        about, which is precisely the lead least like the ICP. A live run made that
        concrete — four consecutive picks at P(f>0.5) ≈ 0.25–0.42, and the verdicts were
        veterinary services, cybersecurity education, K-12 tutoring and a metaverse
        product manager, against a health-and-wellness ICP. Every one an accurate
        rejection, and not one of them a step toward the first acceptance.

        Past the cold phase it is balance-driven as before: exploit once real negatives
        outnumber real positives, explore while the classes are still even.
