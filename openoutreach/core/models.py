class Keyword(models.Model):

    A **single word**, not a phrase. Multi-word values were the old model's silent
    killer: every extra word is another AND (``Manager`` → ``Content Manager`` is a
    ~300× narrowing), so the LLM-written four-token titles the pool used to hold —
    ``Head of Content Strategy``, ``Chief Science Officer`` — were near-empty before
    they were conjoined with anything. Joining tokens is still how the walk narrows,
    but it happens at query time (``discovery.filters_for``), one token per move,
    against measured feedback rather than an LLM's guess at a job title.

    **Globally unique on ``(field, token)``, with no campaign of its own** — a token
    is not campaign-specific, ``lead_location = belgium`` is the same search term
    whoever runs it. A campaign reaches its vocabulary through its query nodes.

    ``field`` is constrained to ``discovery.SEARCH_FIELDS``: the field names are the
    provider contract, and an unknown one is silently *dropped* (you get the
    unfiltered page, with rows, reading as success). ``token`` is deliberately
    **not** constrained — except for ``lead_seniority`` these are free-text search
    terms, and a token the index doesn't carry simply returns an empty page.

class QueryNode(models.Model):
    """One node in a campaign's discovery walk — a keyword set, and where it has been paged to.

    The walk is a **greedy add-only descent over keyword sets**, valued by counting and
    sampled by Thompson. A node is a set of ``(field, token)`` keywords; its children
    are itself plus one more token. There is no remove move — the frontier is global,
    so a shallow node's untried siblings stay reachable without one.

    **This model replaces a whole lattice.** The old walk stored clauses, fetched
    ``DiscoveryQuery`` rows, and an ``EmptyClauseSet`` blacklist, and computed a
    Cartesian product of *maximal* conjunctions on every call — 63,000 candidates for a
    live pool, essentially all of them genuinely empty, because the clause model assumed
    orthogonal facets over what is really a keyword index. See the roadmap card
    ``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``.

    **The node carries no value column.** Its estimate is derived from the label store
    every time it is needed — ``a``/``b`` are the qualified/rejected leads whose profile
    text contains all of this node's tokens — so there is no counter to drift, nothing to
    migrate, and nothing to reconcile after a crash. It is also the *same* estimator
    before and after the node is fired, which is what makes a bad page self-correcting:
    a node that looks good from the store and returns nobody useful has its own misses
    land in the counters that made it look good.

    **``parent`` is the level, not provenance.** A child inherits its parent's measured
    rate as the prior its own counts move off (``select.estimate``), because that
    predicts a child's true precision better than the child's raw counts alone (0.661 vs
    0.653, §13c). A node reachable by several paths — and with add-only over three
    fields most are — is created once on its canonical key and keeps the parent giving
    the **highest** estimate.

    **State is a corpus fact, never a model fact.** A node is retired only for
    emptiness: nothing is ever retired for scoring badly, because the qualifier refits
    constantly and a barren yield is a verdict about a view. Which *kind* of emptiness
    depends on the offset it appeared at, because the provider reports ``0`` both for a
    query that matches nobody and for one paged past its end (§7).
