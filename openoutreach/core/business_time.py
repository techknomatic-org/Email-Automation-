"""Working-day arithmetic — how old a thread really is.

A thread that sat untouched over a weekend has not really gone quiet, and the
outreach agent is told the gap in working days so it reads a Friday reply answered
on Monday as one day old rather than three.

Measuring is all that is left here. ``add_business_hours`` used to schedule the
*next* touch, back when an unanswered thread earned a follow-up on a countdown;
nobody is chased any more, so there is no gap to schedule and the only remaining
question is how much working time has passed.

Public holidays are deliberately not modelled: they are per-country, per-year data
we do not carry, and this figure is coarse enough that a missed holiday costs one
slightly-off number in a prompt.
