# openoutreach/core/pipeline/vocabulary.py
"""The keyword vocabulary — the tokens a discovery query can be built from.

Growth is **counting, not generation**. The old engine asked an LLM to invent clause
values ("propose new job titles adjacent to these leads"), and the LLM wrote prose:
``Head of Content Strategy``, ``Chief Science Officer``, ``Director of Education``.
Every word in a Lead Finder value is another AND, so a four-token title is near-empty
before it is conjoined with anything — a large, independent cause of the 60-consecutive-
empty-query run that started this rewrite. Here the vocabulary is simply *the words that
appear in profiles the LLM already accepted*, one word per keyword, and narrowing happens
by conjoining tokens at query time against measured feedback.

**Admission is document frequency, and it is nearly free.** Over the label store, a df≥2
floor drops 65% of the vocabulary (3,485 → 1,208 tokens) and loses **zero** good tokens —
none with support ≥ 8 and true precision > 0.8 disappears until df≥10. What it removes is
the singleton tail, which is mostly company names and typos (``cloneable.ai``,
``buildteam.ai.``, ``vendbot``) — and that tail is not harmless: it is 56% of the *top* of
any embedding-based ranking, so it would be fired first. See §13a/§13b of the roadmap card
``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``.

**A token's field is measured, not chosen.** ``cto`` is alive in ``lead_job_title`` and
dead everywhere else; ``belgium`` is the reverse. Reading each axis from the lead-row
fields that *are* that axis (``discovery.KEYWORD_SOURCE_FIELDS``) keeps the per-field
vocabularies nearly disjoint at no cost. ``lead_seniority`` is the exception and the
easy case: the provider publishes a closed 12-value list, so it is seeded whole and
never grown.

The upgrade path, if the singleton tail ever needs a sharper cut than df≥2, is Dunning's
log-likelihood ratio — it kills df=1 junk *and* the high-frequency-uninformative tokens a
df floor waves through (``services`` reads 25/34 in the store and would score negative).
Not needed yet.
