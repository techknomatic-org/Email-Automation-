# openoutreach/core/pipeline/icp.py
"""ICP generators — the LLM writes the campaign's cold-start priors, in two shapes.

The same two inputs (``product_docs + campaign_target``) are the only prior available
before any lead has been judged, and the engine needs them expressed two ways:

- ``generate_seed`` — the ICP as a **query**: one value per family (a title, a
  seniority, a country, a size band), the single most precise conjunction the model can
  name. That conjunction is the campaign's whole starting **pool**, so the initial
  maximal set is exactly one query — the seed. Breadth is not seeded; it grows from the
  leads that qualify (``mint.py``), which add more values per family and so more
  maximals for the selector to rank.
- ``generate_anchors`` — the ICP as **profiles**: a few invented leads that would be
  ideal fits, written in the shape ``discovery.profile_text_for`` produces. Embedded and
  handed to the GP as synthetic positives (``BayesianQualifier.set_anchors``), they are
  what lets the model fit at all on a campaign whose every real verdict so far is a
  rejection — a single-class label set never produces a posterior, so without them BALD,
  P(f>0.5), and every piece of steering that reads them stay unavailable for the whole
  cold phase. They are retired one per real acceptance (see
  ``BayesianQualifier.anchor_budget``).

Profiles rather than the product text itself because the space they have to land in is
one of *lead* embeddings: marketing prose about the product embeds nowhere near a row of
firmographics, so it would anchor the model in a region no candidate occupies. They are
also embedded **without** query terms (unlike a discovered lead, whose retrieving query
rides its embedding) — an anchor is a claim about what a good lead looks like, not about
which query to run, and folding the seed's keywords in would have discovery score the
seed highly on the strength of our own guess.

One value per family, never headcount as a range to search: the size band is a single
ICP attribute that rides every maximal unchanged. See ``discovery.filters_for``.

    """The LLM's provider-agnostic ICP output — the walk's opening **vocabulary**.

    Not a query. The seed used to be "one value per family, the single most precise
    conjunction", which is what the clause model needed; the walk now conjoins tokens
    itself against measured feedback, so what it wants from the LLM is *words worth
    trying*, and as many as the ICP genuinely implies.

    **``domain_keywords`` is the field that makes an ICP an ICP.** The old spec had
    nowhere to put "what the target company actually does" — no field for it — so a
    health-and-wellness campaign seeded on ``content``/``lead``/``united``/``states``
    and every query it could compose selected for *role* while being blind to
    *industry*. The obvious home would be ``lead_industry``, and that field is inert:
    a nonsense value returns the identical count to no filter at all (§8 of the roadmap
    card). But domain words are demonstrably alive in ``lead_job_title``, which matches
    title *and* headline text — ``saas`` counts 3,306, ``startup`` 6,223, ``llm`` 1,214,
    ``agentic`` 1,213, ``stealth`` 932 (§10). So they go there, alongside the role words,
    and the frontier conjoins the two.

    ``seniority`` is typed to Lead Finder's vocabulary, not ``str``: an unknown level
    returns an empty page rather than an error, wasting a fetch. Everything else is free
    text — a token the index doesn't carry is a normal empty page, one fetch spent, and
    the walk retires it.
