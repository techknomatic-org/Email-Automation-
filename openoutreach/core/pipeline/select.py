# openoutreach/core/pipeline/select.py
"""Query selection — the frontier is counted, drawn from, and fired. No model involved.

The whole discovery walk, from first principles. A **node** is a set of ``(field, token)``
keywords; firing it pages Lead Finder for the conjunction. Its **children** are itself
plus one more token. There is no remove move: the frontier is global — every unfired child
of every fired node, all in one pool — so a shallow node's untried siblings are always
still reachable and removal would be a second way to say the same thing.

**A node's value is arithmetic over labels.**

    P̂(node) = (a + 2·P̂(parent)) / (a + b + 2)

where ``a``/``b`` are the qualified/rejected leads in the store whose profile contains all
of this node's tokens. That is ordinary Laplace smoothing with the prior pointed at the
**parent's rate** instead of at 0.5, which is the whole idea: the parent supplies the
level, the child's own counts move it off, and a child with thin evidence stays near its
parent rather than swinging to 0 or 1.

**Why not the GP.** It used to score candidates by embedding their keywords. Measured
head-to-head on 4,100 parent→child edges with the GP fit on one half of the labels and
every truth measured on the other, the counts win outright and the GP adds *nothing* on
top of them:

    child counts smoothed to parent   pearson 0.661     P(parent) only        0.567
    P(child) counts alone             0.653             GP(child) alone       0.450
    counts + 0.15·GP delta            0.660             P(parent) + GP delta  0.452

The GP is not gone from the system — it still qualifies leads, and it is what produces the
``a``/``b`` this module counts. It is gone from *choosing queries*. The residual-anchoring
idea (``P(parent) + λ·GP delta``) was measured too: real, but worth 0.02 pearson at
λ≈0.15, and worse than doing nothing at λ=1. See §13 of the roadmap card
``p1-e3-leadfinder-index-semantics-and-query-model-rethink``.

**Sampling is Thompson over the same two numbers.** ``θ ~ Beta(a + 2·P̂(parent), b +
2·(1−P̂(parent)))`` — the Beta parameters *are* the smoothed estimate, so this is one line
rather than a mechanism, and there is no constant to tune. Width tracks evidence:
``Beta(141, 3)`` is razor-tight and ``Beta(2, 1)`` is wide, so a node nobody has tried gets
tried and a node measured bad three times stops appearing. Set ``THOMPSON = False`` to fall
back to greedy — defensible here, because depletion pushes the walk along on its own, and
which is better cannot be settled offline (simulating it needs corpus answers for queries
never fired).

**Retirement is a corpus fact, never a model fact.** Nothing is retired for scoring badly —
the qualifier refits constantly, and a barren yield is a verdict about a view, not about
whether anybody matches. Only emptiness retires a node, and *which* emptiness depends on
the offset, because the provider answers ``0`` both for a query matching nobody and for one
paged past its end (§7).

        a *qualified* profile with the node, and a campaign that has never accepted
        anybody has no qualified profile — so the frontier could not grow past its
        depth-1 seed nodes, which are one-token queries matching millions of the wrong
        people, so nothing qualified, so the frontier still could not grow. A closed

        ``BayesianQualifier`` retires one stored profile per real acceptance and the field
        empties when real positives reach the rejection count, so reading it needs no
        phase check — the invented evidence thins out of this count at exactly the rate
        ground truth replaces it, and is gone when the cold phase is.

        They deliberately do **not** feed the vocabulary (``vocabulary.refresh``): an
        anchor is one flat string with no per-field structure, and splitting it by guess
        would file ``united states`` as a job title — the error
        ``discovery.KEYWORD_SOURCE_FIELDS`` exists to prevent. Anchors say which words go
