"""Find-email pool: GP confidence gate between QUALIFIED and READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL.

The rank gate for the paid action. It promotes only QUALIFIED leads scoring at or
above ``CAMPAIGN_CONFIG["min_gp_confidence"]`` into READY_TO_FIND_EMAIL, so a
BetterContact credit is only ever spent on a ranked lead. ``pools._advance`` reads
the same constant in its exploit branch — a lead below it would be qualified and
then parked here, so it is only worth an LLM call for the label (which exploit does
not want; that is the explore branch's job).

That constant is the **spend gate and nothing else**. Discovery once borrowed it to
score query nodes ("how many of this query's leads would we pay for?"). That was a
category error: calibrated against *labelled* leads the GP has memorized, the bar is
unreachable for the unlabelled candidates a query is made of, so every node scored
zero and discovery read a permanent wall. Discovery now scores queries with the same
GP that ranks leads, on keyword embeddings — never this gate. Keep it that way — see
``pipeline/select.py`` and the roadmap card
``p2-e3-discovery-unified-gp-query-selection``.
