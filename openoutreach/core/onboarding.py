# openoutreach/core/onboarding.py
"""Email-first onboarding as an ordered list of idempotent steps.

First principles
----------------
Onboarding is a **sequence of independent steps**. Each step knows two things:

  * ``is_done()`` — is this already satisfied? (reads the DB, never prompts)
  * ``run()``     — collect what's missing and **persist it immediately**

The runner executes only the steps whose ``is_done()`` is false, in order. Because
every step persists the moment it succeeds, a crash or Ctrl+C mid-onboarding
resumes exactly where it stopped, and a satisfied step is never revisited.

Why this shape kills the "SMTP onboarding keeps looping back" bug:

  * The **only** thing that decides ordering is ``is_done()``. Once a mailbox
    exists, ``mailbox`` is done — the runner cannot land back on it.
  * A step's ``run()`` owns its **own** retry loop. A credential that fails
    verification re-asks *that step's* fields (with what you typed retained) —
    it never rewinds to an earlier step, and never restarts the whole wizard.
  * There is no end-of-wizard ``apply()`` that could half-fail and strand state:
    each step is its own commit point.

Cancellation is a single exception, not a return value threaded through every
caller: the wizard prompts return ``None`` on Ctrl+C, ``_required()`` turns that
into ``OnboardingCancelled`` at one boundary, and steps that want to treat cancel
specially (the mailbox, once one box exists) catch it.

Order: campaign → LLM (live-verified) → **mailbox** (SMTP auth-checked) →
**BetterContact key** → account (your email + country + newsletter + legal, then
the operator ``User``). The mailbox and the BetterContact key are mandatory —
BetterContact powers both discovery and enrichment. The account step asks the
operator's **own email** (the human's inbox — contacts key + newsletter target,
plus a BCC copy of every send on their own campaigns), deliberately distinct from the mailbox ``from_address``; the ``User`` is created
last, after a mailbox exists.

  Welcome to OpenOutreach — a self-hosted AI sales agent that runs your cold
  email funnel end to end: define your ICP, discover leads, qualify them, find a
  verified work email, then send and follow up from a mailbox you own.

  Setup takes a few minutes. Have three things ready:
    • an LLM provider key — the agent qualifies leads and writes your emails
    • a mailbox you own — Gmail, Workspace, or any SMTP inbox
    • a BetterContact key — powers lead discovery and email finding (free tier to start)

  OpenOutreach is free; you pay only the providers above. Stop anytime — setup
