"""When a cold email may leave — the operator's working day, in their own time.

One question, asked at the last gate before a first email is written: is it a
weekday, and is it between 08:00 and 20:00 where the operator is? Openers wait
for the answer; replies never come through here at all.

The timezone is *derived*, never configured. The operator answered one question
at onboarding — their country — and ``pytz.country_timezones`` turns it into a
zone. Countries spanning several zones (US, BR, AU) get the first one the table
lists, which is a deliberate approximation: the point of the window is to keep
sends out of the middle of the night, and no zone within one country is more than
a few hours from any other. A second onboarding question buys, at most, the
difference between 08:00 and 11:00 Eastern.

Nothing here reads a lead's location. We know where the operator is; we never
know where the recipient is, and a campaign may target several countries at once.
