# openoutreach/core/management/commands/reset_pipeline.py
"""Reset a campaign's pipeline state without touching its configuration.

Two scopes, because the two reasons to reset are different:

- **discovery** (the default) — drop the query nodes and the keyword vocabulary so the
  next run re-seeds from the ICP. This is what you want after changing the seed prompt
  or the ICP text: the seed only runs for a campaign with no nodes, so an existing walk
  would otherwise keep the vocabulary it opened with forever. Leads and verdicts survive,
  which is the point — they are the evidence the new walk scores itself against.
- **all** — additionally delete the leads, deals, chat and queued tasks, and clear the
  campaign's anchors and fitted GP. A genuine from-scratch run.

Never touches ``SiteConfig``, the operator account, mailboxes or the campaigns
themselves: those are configuration, not pipeline state.
