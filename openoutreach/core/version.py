"""What build of OpenOutreach is this instance running.

There are no releases — instances deploy by ``git clone`` off ``main``, so the
deployable unit is the commit and the commit *is* the version. This module names
it two ways:

* ``commit_sha`` — the identity. Unique, immutable, and reachable: from it the
  hub can look the build up in the published history.
* ``calver`` — the ordering. ``YYYY.MM.DD`` from the commit's own date, because
  hashes don't compare. Two commits on one day share a date; the sha separates
  them.

``is_dirty`` covers the third case a version has to admit to: a working copy with
uncommitted edits is a build nobody can reconstruct, so claiming to be the commit
would be a false claim. ``None`` means "couldn't tell" — never a hopeful ``False``.

Read straight from ``.git`` (no ``git`` binary needed for the sha, no GitPython)
because the daemon runs from a bind-mounted checkout. ``OPENOUTREACH_BUILD`` wins
when set, for images built without a ``.git`` alongside.
