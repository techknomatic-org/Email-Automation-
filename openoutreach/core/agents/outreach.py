# openoutreach/core/agents/outreach.py
"""The outreach agent: one prompt, one decision type, both ends of the thread.

There is a single conversational agent. The cold open and every later reply are
the same voice doing the same job — Mom Test research, not selling — so they
render from one template (``outreach_agent.j2``) which branches on the only thing
that actually differs: whether a thread exists yet.

- **first touch** (no thread): the agent must ``send_message`` and must supply a
  ``subject``. ``emails/steps/send.py`` sends it and records the thread root.
- **in thread**: the agent only ever runs on a thread the lead has *replied* to —
  the mail pass has already written the reply — so it picks ``send_message`` /
  ``mark_completed`` / ``suppress``. ``emails/steps/reply.py`` executes the choice.

There is no ``wait`` and no follow-up interval, because nobody is chased: silence
is not a decision the agent gets to make, it is simply the absence of work.

``suppress`` is the *worded* unsubscribe — "take me off your list", "stop
emailing me". It threads like any other reply, so the box-wide alias scan in
``emails/classify.py`` can never see it, and the agent reading every reply already
can. It is a stronger statement than ``not_interested``: it ends the thread and
suppresses the person account-wide, across every campaign.

Single LLM call with structured output — no tool-calling loop.
