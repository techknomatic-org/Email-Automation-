"""The three jobs end to end: a reply arrives and the deal becomes actionable.

Everything here goes through ``run_mail_pass`` rather than the jobs individually,
because the property under test spans them — mail lands, is read, and only then
means something. The opt-out half of the same pass is in ``test_unsubscribe.py``.
