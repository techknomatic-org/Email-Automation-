"""State-transition logging in `core/db/deals.set_profile_state`.

The regression locked down here: a `no email` enrichment miss is a benign,
expected terminal outcome, so it has its own terminal state
(`NO_EMAIL_BETTERCONTACT`) that logs as a muted `NO EMAIL` — not the red `FAILED`
reserved for genuine failures.
